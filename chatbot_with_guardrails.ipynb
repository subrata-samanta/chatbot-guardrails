    "\n",
    "- **Prompt Template**: Evaluates if questions relate to banking services (accounts, loans, cards, transactions, security)\n",
    "- **Response Format**: Strictly returns \"yes\" or \"no\" to enable binary decision-making\n",

    "1. `CheckKeywordsRunnable` class: This class inherits from the `Runnable` class and checks if any of the provided keywords are present in the input text.\n",

      "Response: If you suspect that your credit card has been stolen, it's crucial to act quickly to minimize potential unauthorized charges. Here's a step-by-step guide to reporting a stolen credit card:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Contact Your Credit Card Issuer**: Immediately call the customer service number provided by your credit card issuer. This number is typically found on the back of your card, but since the card is stolen, you can find it on the issuer's website or on your billing statement. Inform them that your card has been stolen and ask to block or lock the card to prevent unauthorized transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Verify Recent Transactions**: Review your recent transactions with the customer service representative to identify any unauthorized charges. This will help the issuer understand the extent of potential fraudulent activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Monitor Your Account**: After reporting the theft, keep a close watch on your account statements and online banking portal for any suspicious activity. You might want to sign up for transaction alerts if your issuer offers this service.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Request a Replacement Card**: Ask the issuer to provide you with a replacement card. They will typically issue a new card with a different number and may expedite the shipping to ensure you have a functional card as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **File a Police Report**: While not always necessary, consider filing a police report, especially if you suspect identity theft or if other personal items were stolen along with your card. This report can be useful for insurance purposes and future reference.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Notify Credit Bureaus**: If you’re concerned about identity theft, contact the major credit bureaus—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—to put a fraud alert on your credit report. This alerts creditors to take extra steps to verify your identity before opening new accounts in your name.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Update Automatic Payments**: Don’t forget to update any automatic payments linked to the stolen card with your new credit card information to avoid missed payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking these actions promptly can help protect your financial information and mitigate the risk of fraud. If you need more specific advice tailored to your credit card issuer, visiting their website or reaching out to their customer service might provide more detailed guidance.\n",

      "\n",

      "Response: I'm sorry, but I can't provide specific account details for John or any individual. Protecting personal and sensitive information is very important. If you are needing assistance with an account, I recommend contacting customer service for the specific service or organization directly, where they can securely verify the necessary details.\n",
